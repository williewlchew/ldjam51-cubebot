## About the Game

You are Cubungus, master of running. You awake in a dungeon full of bears andâ€¦ grass? Collect all of the mystic orbs to unlock doors that block your path. Hopefully you can find your coveted carrot stash carrot.

## Game Mechanics

Every 10 seconds the dimension changes. With the change of dimension: the bears change their behaviors and grass may become hazardous warning. Maneuver around the hazards while finding the orbs and switches to unlock various doors and progress.
